        <p id="story">Story:</p>
        <p id="paragraph"> Hachiko was a Japanese Akita who was born on a farm. His owner, Hidesaburō Uneo, was a professor at Tokyo Imperial University in the agriculture department. Everyday, Hachiko would meet his owner at the Shibuya Station Hidesaburō's commute home. However, on May 21, 1925, Ueno suffered a cerebral hemorrhage at work and died. From that day on, Hachiko continued his daily routine of walking to Shibuya Station to await Ueno's return home until his death on March 8, 1935. Today, Hachiko is seen as an example of loyalty and fidelity with statues, movies, books, and media appearances in his honor.</p>
